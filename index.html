            <h3>Welcome</h3><h4>To My Portfolio Website</h4>
            <p>Hi, I'm Adam, a junior software developer. I'll be using this website to work on development with HTML,
                CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. My aim is to keep it lightweight and use it to play with the basic tools. This
                website will be responsive and capable of offering an optimized view on all devices. This is also a
                space for me to blog about my learning journey, which will allow me to learn and play with PHP and a
                little bit of SQL. Lastly, I plan to showcase past projects as well as those I have planned for the
                future.

                I am enthusiastic to earn while I learn and
                am currently open to employment opportunities.
            </p>

            <h3>About Me</h3><h4>Always Under Construction</h4>
            <p>After 12 years of dedicated service, I concluded my military career and began pursuing my life long
                dream of working with computers and building cool things as a job occupation. In the Army, I specialized
                in artillery, a role markedly different from my current pursuit in the tech industry. My interest in
                technology has deep roots, sparked in childhood by gaming and early experiments with computers and
                coding. My interest in these subjects has led to a healthy/unhealthy relationship with optimization and
                user experience.

                At home, I am blessed with a wonderful family. My wife and I are proud parents of two incredible
                daughters. These days, my free time is less about gaming and more about spending time with my family.
                While I am naturally reserved in my personal life, I thrive on collaboration in professional settings,
                finding great satisfaction in achieving milestones as a team.

                I try to learn new things everyday, and have a legimate desire to program cool things. I tend to enjoy
                solving problems, and find great satisfaction in watching a project evolve over time through planning
                and effort. As I become more experienced as a professional developer, I hope to find ways to leverage
                Machine Learning as well.
