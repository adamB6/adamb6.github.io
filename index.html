            <h4>To My Portfolio Website</h4>
            <p>Hi, I'm Adam, a junior web developer. I recently graduated from college, where I discovered a passion for
                web development in my final semester.

                I'll be using this website to focus on development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. It's also a
                space for me to blog about my learning journey, showcasing both my growth and the projects I've worked
                on, as well as those I have planned for the future.

                I am enthusiastic about continuing to learn while contributing to meaningful work and am currently open
                to employment opportunities
            </p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>After 12 years of dedicated service, I concluded my military career with an honorable discharge. In the Army, I specialized in Airborne Artillery, a role markedly different from my current pursuit in the tech industry. My affinity for computers dates back to the '90s, when I first dabbled in programming with Visual Basic. Although becoming a professional developer once seemed beyond my reach, leaving the Army marked the turning point to follow my passion for technology.<br><br>

                At home, I am blessed with a wonderful family. My wife and I are proud parents of two incredible daughters. These days, my free time is less about gaming—a past passion—and more about coding and learning new things in technology. While I am naturally reserved in my personal life, I thrive on collaboration in professional settings, finding great satisfaction in working with others to bring projects to life.<br><br>
                
                Tennessee is where we currently call home, yet Florida, my home state, continues to hold a special place in my heart. Plans to return there hinge on securing a stable job that aligns with my aspirations. My educational journey culminated in a degree in Computer Science, underlining my belief in lifelong learning and adaptability. I am eager to demonstrate these qualities in a professional context. For a deeper insight into my career and skills, my resume is available for download from the 'Home' tab, or you can connect with me via the 'Contact' tab.</p>
