            <h4>To My Portfolio Website</h4>
            <p>Hi, I'm Adam, a junior software developer. I'll be using this website to work on development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. My aim is to not use any frameworks or libraries and to just play with the basic tools. This website will be responsive and capable of offering an optimized experience on all devices. This is also a space for me to blog about my learning journey, which will allow me to learn and play with PHP and a little bit of SQL. Hopefully my experiences will help someone else in the future. Lastly, I plan to showcase past projects as well as those I have planned for the future. 
                <br><br>
                
                I am enthusiastic about continuing to learn while contributing to meaningful work and am currently open to employment opportunities.

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>After 12 years of dedicated service, I concluded my military career with an honorable discharge. In the Army, I specialized in artillery, a role markedly different from my current pursuit in the tech industry. My interest in technology has deep roots, sparked in childhood by gaming and early experiments with Visual Basic. Although becoming a professional developer once seemed beyond my reach, leaving the Army marked the turning point to follow my passion for technology.<br><br>

                At home, I am blessed with a wonderful family. My wife and I are proud parents of two incredible daughters. These days, my free time is less about gaming and more about spending time with my family. While I am naturally reserved in my personal life, I thrive on collaboration in professional settings, finding great satisfaction in achieving milestones as a team.<br><br>
                
                I try to learn new things everyday, and have a legimate desire to program cool things. I tend to enjoying solving problems, and find great satisfaction in watching a project evolve over time. As I become more experienced as a professional developer, I hope to find ways to leverage Machine Learning as well. <br><br>
