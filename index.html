            <h4>To My Portfolio Website</h4>
            <p>Hi, I'm Adam, a junior web developer. I recently graduated from college, where I discovered a passion for
                web development in my final semester.

                I'll be using this website to focus on development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. It's also a
                space for me to blog about my learning journey, showcasing both my growth and the projects I've worked
                on, as well as those I have planned for the future.

                I am enthusiastic about continuing to learn while contributing to meaningful work and am currently open
                to employment opportunities
            </p>

            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>As a proud military veteran with 12 years of service, I transitioned from airborne artillery in the army to following my passion in the realm of computers. Despite the stark contrast between these fields, my enthusiasm for technology, kindled by an early encounter with Visual Basic in the 90s, never waned. Post-discharge, I embraced the opportunity to turn my long-held dream into reality: a career in computer science.<br><br>

                Balancing my professional aspirations, I am blessed with a fulfilling personal life, happily married with two wonderful daughters. While I cherish quiet moments in my personal sphere, I thrive on collaboration in professional settings. Working alongside others to bring projects to life energizes me. Our family currently calls Tennessee home, yet my heartstrings are tugged towards Florida, my birthplace, where I aspire to return following the establishment of a stable career.<br><br>
                
                I hold a degree in Computer Science with a general concentration, a testament to my belief in continuous learning and adaptability. My academic and life experiences have instilled a confidence in me that with dedication, I can master any challenge. I eagerly await the opportunity to demonstrate this versatility in the professional world.<br><br>
